# deliver
to deliver products and services with emotions and motives
It is my personal project :) . Not to be viewed for evaluation of my candidature against job application or contract proposals! 

## app category and business domains
- booking experience
- self pickup by recepients

## development approach
- *Phase 1:* First of all, create a dirty monolith app, which is not thread safe inherently and has much more of code smell as well :( .
- *Phase 2:* Then split it into microservices and define RESTful APIs for integration.
- *Phase 3:* Dockerise the microservices, with an allowance for keeping closely related microservices within shared containers.
- *Phase 4:* Make use of concurrent collection types for better throughput.
- Phases 2 and 3 will go hand in hand, right since the beginning.

## status
work in progress
Currently, in Phase 2 and Phase 3.
